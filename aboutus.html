    <h2>
        Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited was a British motor car manufacturer. <br> With its works at Moorfields in Blakenhall, a suburb of Wolverhampton in Staffordshire, now West Midlands.</br><br> Its Sunbeam name had been registered by John Marston
        in 1888 for his bicycle manufacturing business. Sunbeam motor car manufacture began in 1901. The motor business was sold to a newly incorporated Sunbeam Motor Car Company Limited in 1905 to separate it from Marston's pedal bicycle business; Sunbeam
        motorcycles were not made until 1912.
